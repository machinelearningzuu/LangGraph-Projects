# LangGraph-Projects

Welcome to the LangGraph Projects repository! This is a collaborative space where we develop and share projects related to the LangGraph, to write better and scalable LLM applications.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is an extension of LangChain, which allows us to build cyclic, stateful, multi-actor agent systems. It implements a graph structure with nodes and edges. The nodes are functions or tools, and the edges are the connections between nodes. Edges are of two types: conditional and normal. One key note is that this can be seen as a massive extension of LCEL.

## Projects

In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects that extend the functionality of LangGraph or use its data in innovative ways. Each project has its own directory containing all the necessary files, documentation, and resources.
